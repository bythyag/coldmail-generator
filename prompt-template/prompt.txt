## Few-Shot Examples

### Example 1: Archaeology Research Position

**Input:**
Student: First-year graduate student in archaeology interested in cultural artifacts and snake phobia research
Professor: Dr. Jones - Published paper on reptiles in antiquities retrieval with focus on psychosomatic aversion to snakes

**Output:**
```
Dr. Jones,

My name is Myra Smith and I'm a first-year graduate student in the archaeology program.

I was intrigued by your paper on the contravening impact of reptiles in the antiquities retrieval process. The section on the psychosomatic aspects of an archaeologist's anathema toward snakes was particularly compelling and inspired; I cited it in my graduate thesis on the intersection of biology and archaeology.

As an aspiring swashbuckling archeologist with an academic specialization on mythical religious antiquities and invertebrate avoidance, I would appreciate an opportunity to talk with you about joining your research group for the upcoming year (and beyond).

My resume is attached and I am available for a chat in person, on Zoom, or over the phone. Please let me know if we can schedule a time.

Regards,
Myra Smith

**Output:**
```

While at Berkeley, I developed an interest in the consulting and strategy industry through my involvement in consulting organizations and internship experiences.
